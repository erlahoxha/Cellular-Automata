# Cellular-Automata
Experimenting Cellular Automata with three and five neighborhoods

# Overview
This repository contains Python implementations of one-dimensional cellular automata with three and five neighborhood rules. Cellular automata (CA) are simple computational systems that evolve over discrete time steps based on predefined rule sets. The two implementations provided here explore different rule sets and their effects on pattern generation.
For an in-depth analysis of the behaviors and classifications of different cellular automata, please refer to my paper: Experimenting with Cellular Automata.
The paper explores:

-  Theoretical background of cellular automata.
-  Various rule sets and their classifications.
-  Experimental results for both three-neighbor and five-neighbor automata.

# Implementations
1. Three-Neighbor Cellular Automaton (CellularAutomaton.py)

-  Uses a one-dimensional grid where each cell has two neighbors (left and right).
-  Implements a rule set similar to Wolfram’s elementary CA.
-  Generates complex patterns such as the Sierpiński triangle.

2. Five-Neighbor Cellular Automaton (FiveCellAutomaton.py)

-  Expands the neighborhood to include two additional neighbors on each side.
-  Supports a larger rule space (32 possible neighborhood configurations).
-  Produces more intricate and varied patterns compared to the three-neighbor version.
# Running the Simulations
